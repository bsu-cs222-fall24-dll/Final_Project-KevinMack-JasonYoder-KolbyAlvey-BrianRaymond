<h1>Restaurant Management System</h1>

<h2>Kolby Alvey, Kevin Mack, Brian Raymond, Jason Yoder</h2>
<br>
Currently, this project contains a waitlist and host system for a restaurant with full functionality. Ignore the button titled "kitchen", that will be coming shortly.
<br>
<h2>Waitlist</h2>
The waitlist allows the user to add and remove specific parties, the waitlist will automatically sort the party list by wait time (smallest to largest). 
The waitlist also has error handling for numbers too large or non-digits being entered into integer fields.
<h2>Host System</h2>
The host system shows the layout of a dining room, and allows the user to click a table to declare it occupied or open.
If the table is occupied, a timer will increment until it changed to open again, showing restaurant staff how long tables have been sitting.
<h2>To Come</h2>
To come: back-of-the-house management menus.
<h2>Build Instructions</h2>
To build and run, download the code and run the application through Gradle. (Open Gradle menu -> Tasks -> application -> run)
